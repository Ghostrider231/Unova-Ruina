# Unova-Ruina
A GZDoom/Zandronum Total Conversion project that features the enitre Unova Region recreated in the Doom Engine, new gameplay and mechanics, and a new setting/story!  

NOTE: This project is still in heavy work in progress. We're not at a playable state yet! Probably for a little while :p  
(This project used to be named Pokemon zDoom Unova, but was shafted as a codename for the Unova Ruina name.)
